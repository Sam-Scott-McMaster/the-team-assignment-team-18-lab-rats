What proteins link T-tubules and the sarcoplasmic reticulum? | DHP receptors and Ryanodine receptors
What factors regulate force production of a muscle? | Muscle LENGTH, action potential FREQUENCY, NUMBER of fibres per motor unit and cross-sectional areas of those muscle fibres.
How do action potentials affect force production of the muscle? | action potentials cause release of Ca2+ into cells -- more action potentials means the sarcoplasmic reticulum remains open, so more Ca2+ enters muscle cells.
What are the names of the two spinal rami? What do they each innervate? | Dorsal (posterior) rami: deep back muscles, zygapophyseal joints; Ventral (anterior) Rami: everything else!
What is C8 and where is it located? | A spinal nerve! Below the cervical vertebra (C1-C7) and above the thoracic/lumbar vertebra
