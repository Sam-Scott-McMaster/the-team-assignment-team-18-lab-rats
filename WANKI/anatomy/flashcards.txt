Which 3 bones fuse at the acetabulum? | Ilium, ischium, pubis
What type of joint is the sacroiliac joint? | bilateral, synovial joint
Which two ligaments support the sacroiliac joint? | sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments
What type of joint is the hip joint? | ball and socket joint
What are the 5 main muscle groups controlling hip movement? | flexors, extensors, abductors, adductors, and deep rotators
What is the definition of homeostasis? | A relatively stable state of equilibrium or a tendency toward such a state between the different but interdependent elements or groups of elements of an organism, population, or group.
What are the two means of maintaining homeostasis? | positive feedback, negative feedback
What is something that moves a system away from its set point called? | stimulus
What does a detector or receptor do in homeostasis? | detect change in a variable from its setpoint
What is the optic nerve composed of and what does it do? | formed from axons of cells within the retina. It transmits visual info to the cortex.
What are mammillary bodies responsible for? | Storing and collecting memories.
Give an example of a structure that has only sympathetic input | Sweat glands
What are the receptors in the autonomic nervous system and where are they found? | cholinergic receptors, found in synpases of the sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia + the postganglionic parasympathetic effectors; adrenergic receptors, found only on the sympathetic postganglionic target organs.
Where do nuclei reside within muscle cells? | On the periphery.
What are sarcomeres made of? | Actin = thin filament, Myosin = thick filament
What proteins link T-tubules and the sarcoplasmic reticulum? | DHP receptors and Ryanodine receptors
What factors regulate force production of a muscle? | Muscle LENGTH, action potential FREQUENCY, NUMBER of fibres per motor unit and cross-sectional areas of those muscle fibres.
How do action potentials affect force production of the muscle? | action potentials cause release of Ca2+ into cells -- more action potentials means the sarcoplasmic reticulum remains open, so more Ca2+ enters muscle cells.
What are the names of the two spinal rami? What do they each innervate? | Dorsal (posterior) rami: deep back muscles, zygapophyseal joints; Ventral (anterior) Rami: everything else!
What is C8 and where is it located? | A spinal nerve! Below the cervical vertebra (C1-C7) and above the thoracic/lumbar vertebra
